Ranger TDI Overland Build

Overview

This repo documents the full build of a 1994 Ford Ranger 4x4 extended cab, transforming it from a lightly modified truck into a rugged, diesel-powered, soundproofed, overlanding-capable machine designed for reliability, comfort, and full digital integration.

This project combines mechanical, electrical, and software engineering with a deep attention to modular design and real-world reliability. The final goal is a truck that can traverse the Rocky Mountains, work comfortably in harsh Wyoming winters, support overlanding and elk hunting expeditions, and function as a mobile software workstation for professional field work.

Phase 0: Stock Restoration

Goal: Get all factory systems operational and reliable

Phase 1: Powertrain Swap

VW TDI + NSG370 6-speed + NV241 Transfer Case

Engine: VW TDI (BRM preferred, BEW backup)

Transmission: NSG370 6-speed manual

Transfer Case: NP/NV241

Adapter kits sourced for engine/trans and trans/TC

Keep TDI in low-rpm torque band

Daily driver + cold climate + overland capable

Phase 2: Axles and Gearing

Rear: Ford 8.8" LS (existing) → 4.56:1 gears + TruTrac + Disc brake conversion

Front: Dana 35 TTB → 4.56:1 gears + TruTrac + D44 knuckle swap

Consider full-width D44 TTB / 8.8" from Bronco/F150 for hybrid delete

Phase 3: Suspension & Steering

Long travel radius arm front setup

Rear: 4-link with coil-overs

Coil-overs on all 4 corners

Greasable heim joints for steering

Crossover steering upgrade

Greasable poly bushings throughout

Phase 4: HVAC and Interior Comfort

Vintage Air universal HVAC system

Dakota Digital climate control module

Sound deadening (floor, firewall, doors, headliner)

Replace/repair all interior wiring as needed

Replace all lighting with LEDs

Install Escort GT seats with Katskin heated kits

Phase 5: Power Infrastructure

Dual battery setup (AGM or glass mat)

Batteries mounted inside extended cab (replacing jump seats)

Ventilation for batteries

12v fuse block + relays

Electric cab heater w/ thermostat (33°F on, 50°F off)

Redarc or Renogy DC-DC charger

Maintain shore power junction block behind grille

Phase 6: Overland Rack & Solar

Full bed rack system

Fold-out rooftop tent

Forward-facing solar panel (100–200W)

MPPT charge controller

Soft white LED bed lighting

Raptor liner coating (Dark Navy primary, Grey/White accent)

Bed and body re-finish

Phase 7: Digital Command Center

Dell Optiplex micro workstation (8th Gen Core i5)

Raspberry Pi 4: Input aggregation + telemetry/diagnostics

Custom Linux environment (Debian base)

USB audio routing

Camera inputs for thermal, dash, rear-view

Tablet-based interface (Galaxy Tab or similar)

Phase 8: Vision & Sensors

BMW/Mercedes thermal camera integration

Camera feeds routed to Pi → Optiplex → Dashboard display

WiFi puck + booster antenna

Internal system syncing with home server (R730)

Phase 9: Gauges and Instrument Cluster

Investigate reuse of stock Ranger gauges w/ TDI

CANBUS adapter or Arduino-based gauge translator

Keep classic aesthetic with modern input mapping

Interface with digital systems (Pi, Optiplex)

Phase 10: Camping & Utility

Truck tent for in-bed use

Shower awning

Inverter mounted behind driver seat

Power tool charging station (Ryobi ecosystem)
